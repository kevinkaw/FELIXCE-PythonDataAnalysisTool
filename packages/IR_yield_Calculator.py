        Initialize the IR yield calculator for mass spectrometry photodissociation analysis.
        
        This class performs infrared yield calculations on mass spectrometry data by comparing
        signal intensities with and without IR radiation to determine photodissociation efficiency.
        The calculator handles peak detection, signal integration, and depletion analysis for
        molecular complexes and their isotopic variants.

                                                Should correspond to mass_range indices. Default: None.

            - All parameters are optional for flexible initialization
            - Typical workflow: initialize → set data → calculate_IR_yield() → IR_yield_spectra()
            - The class supports both single-mass and multi-isotope analysis
            - Mass ranges should be calibrated and correspond to intensity data indices
            - IR yield represents photodissociation efficiency: higher values = more dissociation

        Compile IR yield spectra by accumulating results across multiple wavenumber measurements.
        
        This method builds a comprehensive IR yield spectrum by calculating the IR yield for the
        current wavenumber and appending it to the accumulated spectral data. It serves as the
        primary interface for constructing complete IR action spectra from individual wavenumber
        measurements.
        
        The method performs two key operations:
        1. Calculates IR yield for the current wavenumber setting
        2. Appends the result to the growing spectral dataset
        
        This accumulative approach allows for building IR action spectra point-by-point,
        where each point represents the photodissociation efficiency at a specific wavenumber.
        
        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Complete IR yield spectrum containing all accumulated measurements.
                        Each row represents one wavenumber measurement with columns:
                        - "wavenumber": IR wavenumber (cm⁻¹)
                        - "integrated_signal_withoutIR": Total signal without IR
                        - "integrated_signal_withIR": Total signal with IR
                        - "depletion": Signal depletion ratio
                        - "-ln(depletion)": IR yield measure
        
        Attributes Modified:
            self.IR_yield_spectra (pd.DataFrame): Updated spectrum with new wavenumber data appended
            self.table_IR_yield (pd.DataFrame): Current wavenumber results (via calculate_IR_yield())
            
        Note:
            - Automatically calls calculate_IR_yield() to ensure current data is processed
            - Uses pandas.concat() with axis=0 to append rows (wavenumber measurements)
            - Preserves all previous measurements in the accumulated spectrum
            - Ideal for iterative spectrum construction in measurement loops
            - The resulting DataFrame can be used directly for plotting action spectra
            
        Example:
            >>> calculator = IR_yield_Calculator(wavenumber=1450.5, mass_peaks=[150.0, 151.0])
            >>> # First measurement at 1450.5 cm⁻¹
            >>> spectrum = calculator.IR_yield_spectra()
            >>> 
            >>> # Change wavenumber and add second point
            >>> calculator.wavenumber = 1451.0
            >>> spectrum = calculator.IR_yield_spectra()  # Now contains 2 points
            >>> 
            >>> # Plot the accumulated spectrum
            >>> plt.plot(spectrum['wavenumber'], spectrum['-ln(depletion)'])
